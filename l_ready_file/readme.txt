This code is a sample of some taken from a covid19 project, that I created in collboration with a friend. If you actually wanted to run the code, your system would need to have certain dependencies installed, including Python, Bokeh, Jupyter Notebook, and access to a particular Google BigQuery database. Given the need for those dependencies to actually run this code, I am including it mostly just to allow you to look at some code samples, if you wish.

Broadly speaking, the code retrieves Covid-19 related data from Google BigQuery, and allows a user to interactively display a variety of data visualizations, created using Bokeh.
